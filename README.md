## 🌟 About This Project

Welcome to the **Battery Health Simulator**! This interactive Streamlit application lets you explore the fascinating world of battery degradation. Ever wondered how your charging habits, temperature, or usage patterns affect your device's battery life over time? This simulator provides a clear, data-driven visualization, helping you understand and predict your battery's State of Health (SoH) and capacity.

This project showcases my expertise in:

* **Building dynamic and interactive web applications** with **Streamlit**.
* **Data visualization** using **Plotly** to create compelling and insightful graphs.
* **Implementing simulation models** to predict complex real-world phenomena.
* **Developing user-friendly interfaces** with customizable parameters.
* **Python programming** for data manipulation and numerical computation (**NumPy**, **Pandas**).

## 🚀 Key Features

* **📊 Customizable Simulations:** Adjust initial capacity, charge cycles, temperature, charging habits, and more to create personalized scenarios.
* **📈 Interactive Visualizations:** Dynamic Plotly charts show battery degradation over time, with key SoH thresholds highlighted.
* **✅ Real-time Feedback:** Get instant insights into your battery's projected lifespan and health status.
* **💡 Smart Recommendations:** Receive actionable tips to improve battery longevity based on simulation outcomes.
* **📥 Data Export:** Download simulation data in CSV format for further analysis.
* **📱 Responsive Design:** Seamless experience across various devices.

## 🚦 How to Run Locally

Get this simulator up and running on your machine in no time!

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd battery-health-simulator
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (highly recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install the necessary libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project with `streamlit`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `plotly` listed.)*
4.  **Launch the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run your_app_file_name.py # Replace 'your_app_file_name.py' with the actual name of your Streamlit script
    ```
5.  Your web browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:8501` (or the address shown in your terminal).

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

I'm always looking to refine and expand my projects! Here are some exciting ideas for future iterations:

* **More Granular Control:** Add options for specific charging protocols (e.g., trickle charging).
* **Multiple Battery Comparison:** Allow users to simulate and compare multiple battery scenarios side-by-side.
* **Temperature Impact Curve:** Implement a more detailed temperature degradation model.
* **User Profiles:** Enable users to save and load their simulation settings.
* **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy the application to a cloud platform like Streamlit Community Cloud or Heroku for public access.
